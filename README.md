[Deepak Chopra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepak_Chopra) - an author, meditator, and advocate of alternative medicine - has an interesting take on the advancement of technology. Where most in his field might be skeptical and say that we should limit our interaction with technology, he imbraces all the technology. He uses it to help monitor his health and even regulate his circadian rythms to something closer to what they should be naturally. I found it refreshing that his stance was so tech-positive. Fowler even brought up the debate about kids using technology instead of going out doors. Chopra response was just that every generation is going to be different and have access to different advancements and that we as humans should embrace that instead of trying to limit it. 

Chopra does however limit his time with phone to specific hours so I wonder what his response would be to the "glued to our phones" debate. He also has a very realistic idea of how the technology should be approached and that everything gets tested and reviewed. However, overall he has a wonderful outlook on how technology will overall help our society. With everything moving forward, those who don't embrace the technolgy advancements will get left behind. 

Also, this is my favorite line from the article:

While I do agree with Chopra's ideas about embracing technology, I am also slightly hesitant to go to the extreme that he advocates for. Humans and animals are special in the sense that we have innate ability to sense the world around us. By allowing technology to drive everything, we start to become desensitized and lose the ability to do things we were previously capable of. For example, prior to the phone, people still managed to read a paper map and get around. However, hand anyone a physical map today and expect them to navigate is a tall ask. I'm not advocating for a world without GoogleMaps, just one where we still retain some of our human roots and don't rely on technology for everything.
